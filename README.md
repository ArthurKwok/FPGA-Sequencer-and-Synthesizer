# FPGA-Sequencer-and-Synthesizer

Introduction
=
This is the GitHub page for an FPGA sequencer and synthesizer, which is the project of the course *Digital System Design (EE332)* in *Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)*. <br>
The main contributors to this project are:<br>`Zhuowen Lin`<br>`Jinyue Guo`<br>
The language we use is *VHDL* with *Nexys 4 DDR board* hardware implementation.
